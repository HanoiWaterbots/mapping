              <p>I am the project coordinator of Hanoi Waterbots (project funded by HKU GHELC) that aims to build semi-autonomous robots for systematic monitoring and estimation of pollution in the Red River of Hanoi, Vietnam. The project will be in effect from 15-30 June 2018. In March 2018, I was a part of the team that was sent on an experiential learning trip to Jaipur to discover and explore overseas experiential learning opportunities for engineering students at HKU. Priyank Sharma is an Indian actor, dancer and choreographer. He is best known for participating in the reality TV show Bigg Boss 11 in 2017.</p>

              <h6>Computer Science, Year 2</h6>
              <p>I have a keen interest in problem-solving and computer programming. I also like to work with electronics as a hobby. I have previously been to a few hackathons and have experience in server-side programming in languages like Node.js and Python. I am familiar with cloud computing services like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku and have worked with SQL and Mongo databases. In addition, I have experience working with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and ESP for IoT applications. Presently, a part of TecHKU, I am working actively with a team of developers to build campus-life solutions at HKU.</p>

              <p>Since the beginning of my mechanical engineering studies,  I started my interest in studying robotics. I already acquired a wide range of experience in DIY  and crafting in my secondary school life, from the Design and Technology club activity and related competition(Infrastructure Building Competition for Secondary Schools and Solar RC car contest), and is recently working of "donkey Car", which is a DIY self driving  RC cars that involves Raspberry Pi and Python.</p>

            <h6>Computer Engineering, Year 4</h6>
            <p>I have extensive experience in mobile app and web development. I also have experience in Arduino programming on a course project, in which I connected the Arduino board to wifi and sent the data collected from the sensor to cloud. Moreover, my machine learning and data analysis skills may be helpful in processing and analyzing the pollution data. I sincerely hope that my technical skills are not only used for earning moneys, but also for helping with the issues that are crucial but less people pay attention to.</p>

Furthermore, I solemnly believe that this is a great venue to explore and improve my knowledge and understanding about real-life applications of classroom taught material. Given the aforementioned reasoning I believe I present myself as a viable candidate for this project.</p>

            <p> As I understand you need someone to map the data that is collected during the project and be able to efficiently display the important findings from the same. I am second year computer science student. My experience from past 6 years of working with JAVA allows me to be very familiar with the GUI part of the language. This makes me very capable for making the programs required by the project. Furthermore, studying advanced linear algebra as a part of my math minor lets me have good knowledge about how to perform required transformations of the data provided. </p>

I think I have acquired related studies on Biological field (Marine biology 3301 and 4301) as well as Toxicology (BIOL3109, 3110). I would like to apply the knowledge I have learnt in textbook to serve the local people and at the same time learning more about the situation on the Vietnam marine lives and the relationship to the livelihood of the local villagers. </p>

            <p>With the data waterbots collected, a reusable and maintainable project will be created to monitor the levels of pollution in the red river, which will bring strong impact for the local communities to take care more of the habitable surroundings. Furthermore, I would like to ensure the integrity of the data that the waterbots will be collecting. I hope I could help with the database collection and visualization for this project, which will definitely deepen the understanding of the pollution of the red river for local people.</p>

Therefore, this project will enable me to find out the causes of the pollution, learn more about project design and implementation, and create benefits to the affected community in Viet Nam in the future. Besides the above reasons, I believe my past experiences will enable me to contribute to the development of the project.</p>
